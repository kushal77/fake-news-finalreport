# intelligent-systems-project

The goal of this project is to create an intelligent service that predicts whether a news article is fake news or not. Fake news is a real-world problem that affects businesses and the society at large. The project involves the group working with a dataset containing real and fake news articles. The task is to train a set of simple and a set of more advanced classifiers to solve this problem. This project covers the full intelligent systems programming pipeline, from data processing to modelling, and measuring the performance of the system.
